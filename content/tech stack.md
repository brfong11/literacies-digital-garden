> **In technology, a stack is a metaphor**: a way of visualizing a collection of software systems used together to get work done.

One important part of [[reading]] any digital [[text]] that is often overlooked is the software and hardware that powers the [[text]]. This digital garden is intentionally built to avoid google software. 

As someone who grew up in Silicon Valley and at one point [[wanted to be a programmer]], I am deeply concerned about the ways that large capitalist tech corporations increasingly structure our lives. Google suite, for example, has a chokehold on the educational market. In SFUSD, we use nearly all of our worksheets, presentations, student writing, grading, and other day to day facets of teaching is produced and stored on google servers. We do not own that data. It is owned by a cooperation who who profits off of apartheid [^1] and greenwashing.[^2]

The [Tech Won't Save Us](https://techwontsave.us/) podcast (a digital and audio [[text]]) chronicles how the capitalist and facist interests in Silicon Valley seek to shape our future. They insist that tech is "inherently political" and "encourages listeners to think beyond the confines of the capitalist tech industry, to consider how we can dismantle oppressive technologies, and how technology can be developed for the public good."[^3]

In contrast, this website is written in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a notetaking app that stores the information in local [plain text](https://lib-static.github.io/concepts/plaintext/) [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files. These files are used to generate a [static website](https://lib-static.github.io/concepts/static-site-generators/).

The design of this project intends to follow the Lib-Static approach, a "development methodology that leverages static web technologies and librarian skills to create engaging web publications hosted on minimal infrastructure."[^4] This [[digital garden]] is [[open ]]source; [check out the code repository.](https://github.com/brfong11/literacies-digital-garden)

By taking an [[open]] approach, this [[digital garden]] intends to disrupt the hegemony of tech capitalist platforms and increase digital [[literacy]] by exposing the how [[power shapes digital texts]].
