>I taught autoethnography as a strategic pedagogical tool for students to examine the ways they experience, exist, and explain their identities—who they are, what they stand for, and why—and to recognize their racial, cultural, and gendered social relations. The objectives of performing autoethnographies were similar to how Alexander (1999) used autoethnographic research “as a way of reading between the lines of [our] own lived experience and the experiences of cultural familiars—to come to a critical understanding of self and other and those places where we intersect and overlap” (p. 310). In contrast to autobiographies, which focus on the unique qualities of individuals, autoethnographies compel authors to foreground their experiences in relation to a larger social group.
