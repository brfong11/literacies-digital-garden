Traditionally, texts take the form of primary and secondary sources that are analyzed through [[historical thinking skills]]. Taking a look at the [Digital Inquiry Group's](https://inquirygroup.org/) (formerly known as Stanford History Education Group) website, historical texts include photographs, historical written documents, textbook pages, laws, decrees, that are hand chosen by a teacher for an inquiry. 

The intention of these inquiries is to get students to "think like a historian" and learn the discipline of history by doing the discipline of history.

If a teacher (like myself) places heavy emphasis on historical thinking skills, this can contribute to the existing [["scriptural economy"]][^1] by placing value on particular [[text|texts]] that mimic the form and function of those produced by the ruling class. In [[Paris-TextingIdentitiesLessons-2010.pdf|Texting Identities]], Paris proposes breaking with these hegemonic texts through examining the "counter scriptural economy" of youth space through "identity [[text|texts]]."[^2]
