>A FRAYER MODEL is a graphic organizer that helps students determine or clarify the meaning of vocabulary words encountered while listening, reading, and viewing texts. It is used before reading to activate background knowledge, during reading to monitor vocabulary, or after reading to assess vocabulary.

The Frayer model is the primary mode by which I have had students learn new vocabulary as part of their [[literacy]] formation in the discipline of history. The model was introduced to me by my cooperating teacher, a long timer newcomer/ELL teacher.
