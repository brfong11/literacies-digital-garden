My parents taught me how to read. Growing up, my mom would sit us down before bed and read us a picture book. When we got older they became chapter books. Reading biblical texts shaped [[my values]]. Still today, before I read before I sleep.

My teachers taught me how to read. In high school, I [[wanted to be a programmer]], but Ms. Savin taught me how to read english literature. In her AP Lit class, I learned how to identify literary themes and strategies. How to analyze a [[text]] and ponder its significance. When I got to college, I learned in [[Foundations of History]] how to read in the discipline specific way of history.

> The fundamental idea of disciplinary literacy is that texts are not read or written in the same ways and that each discipline has its own rules of evidence and ways of using language. The only way students are likely to learn to be [[literacy|literate]] in these specialized ways is through a kind of apprenticeship that brings them into participation in the discipline rather than as just an observer or a consumer.
